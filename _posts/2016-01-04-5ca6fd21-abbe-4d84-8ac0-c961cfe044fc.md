Outboard is a company John Atwood created to represent
his team's own, self-directed projects. We have decided 
however, that beginning in 2013 we will use the name Outboard 
to represent all our endeavors, including our graphic design,
marketing and branding work as well as our entrepreneurial
projects, products and video work.
Outboard is a reference to power, water, action, creativity,
self-sufficiency and the excitement of setting off from the coast.
It makes us think of fine-tuning an idea so it works better
and can take you someplace cool.
It makes us happy.
